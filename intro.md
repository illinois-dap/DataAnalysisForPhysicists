# Instrumentation Physics Applications of Machine Learning

* Physics 503, Fall 2023
* Meeting: Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:00 pm to 2:15 pm
* Room: 262 Loomis Laboratory
* 4 credit hours
* Course Text: This one! However, see supplementary reading suggestions throughout the course. 

## Overview
Welcome! Data is everywhere. Efficient data analysis leading to solid conclusions requires performant tools and rigorous mathematical techniques tethered by sound scientific methods. 

This course is designed to give students a solid foundation in machine learning applications to physics, positioning itself at the intersection of machine learning and data-intensive science. This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of analysis and interpretation of scientific data, and applications of machine learning to problems common in laboratory science such as classification and regression. There will be two 75-minute classes each week, split into discussions of core principles and hands-on exercises involving coding and data. There will be a few projects throughout semester that will build on the course material and utilize open source software and open data in physics and related fields. The list of topics will evolve, according to the interests of the class and instructors. Material will be clustered into units of varying duration, as indicated below. The lists of suggested readings and references are advisory; a large amount of material of excellent quality is now available on the worldwide web, particularly on the sites of university courses addressing the topics of each unit.

A distinguishing feature of this course is its sharp focus on endeavors in the data-rich physical sciences as the arenas in which modern machine learning techniques are taught. The course uses open scientific data, open source software from data science and physics-related fields, and publically-available information as enabling elements. Research-inspired projects are an important part of the course and students will not only execute them but will play an active role in helping define and shape them. Example projects might include machine learning approaches to searches for new particles or interactions at high-energy colliders; methods of particle tracking and reconstruction; identification, classification and measurement of astrophysical phenomena; novel approaches to medical imaging and simulation using techniques from physics and machine learning; machine learning in quantum information science. Through these projects and the course material, students will learn how large datasets in physics are generated, curated, and analyzed, using machine learning as a tool to generate key insights in both experimental and theoretical science.

## Coursework

### Homework Assignments
You will be assigned weekly homework assignments that will put into practice what you learned in lecture for the week. 
* You will work on the assignments both during the in-class session on Thursdays and as homework.
* Each assignment is due at the beginning of the next class unless otherwise noted. You may turn assignment in up to one week late for 50% credit (except that all assignments are strictly due the day before Reading Day).
* Solutions to the homeworks will not be given.
* You may collaborate on assignments but must submit your own work.
* Graded homework will be available through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)

### Final Project
At appropriate times throughout the course, you will select from a list of projects that involve demonstrating and extending your work in class by doing something cool and interesting in data analysys. You must work alone on this (i.e. without collaboration). 

For the final project you will put together a jupyter notebook that demonstrates your project. The notebook should have code and demonstrate the task but also be written in an expository way that other students could, in principle, read and learn from. It is submitted in an analogous way as the regular course assignments.

The final notebook must be submitted via Gradescope for grading on or before ___Xday, December XX, 2023 at 5:00 pm US Central time___.

## Grading
* Class attendence and participation: 5%
* Homework: 65%
* Projects: 30%

Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

| Letter | Low % | High % |
|--------|-------|--------|
| A+     | 97.0  | 100.0  |
| A      | 93.0  | 96.9   |
| A-     | 90.0  | 92.9   |
| B+     | 87.0  | 89.9   |

## Policies

### Covid 

* Policies as it relates to COVID-19 can be found at https://covid19.illinois.edu
* If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, you should contact your instructor immediately, and you are encouraged to copy your academic advisor. 
  
### About using code you find on the web for homework and project(s)
The quickest way to deal with the arcana of programing is to ask Google for examples of what you are seeking to accomplish. But you will need to use your judgment in doing this: the Google search “how do I use color maps in python?” is fine, while “show me a script that calculates pi” is not. And you should always credit the original source of code that you paste into your own programs in a comment that includes the URL for the original code. If an author says that his/her code is not to be copied or incorporated into your programs, then DON’T.

### Academic Integrity
You must never submit the work of someone else as your own. We understand that many of you will find it helpful to work with other students to master Physics 398DAP. But when you collaborate with your study group on homework assignments, you must be a full, active participant in developing the solutions that you submit for credit.

It is cheating to receive answers from another student and then use them as your own. It is cheating to submit as your own work solutions that you find by searching on the worldwide web (though see "About using code you find on the web"), or by subscribing to an online service that suborns cheating. It is cheating—and a violation of U.S. copyright law—to give (or sell) course material to someone else who intends to redistribute and/or sell it.

All activities in this course, are subject to the Academic Integrity rules as described in [Article 1, Part 4, Academic Integrity](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401), of the [Student Code](https://studentcode.illinois.edu).
