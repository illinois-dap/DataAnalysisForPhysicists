# Data Analysis for Physics

* Physics 398DAP, Fall 2023
* Tuesday & Thursday 10:30 - 11:50 am CST
* Room: Loomis 226
* 3 credit hours
* Course Text: This one! However see supplementary reading suggestions throughout the course. 

Welcome! Data is everywhere. Efficient data analysis leading to solid conclusions requires performant tools and rigorous mathematical techniques tethered by sound scientific methods. In this course, you are going to learn and put into practice the fundamentals of probability and data analysis from a physics perspective. The methods of extracting meaningful information from data using probability theory and statistical analyses will be presented. Additionally, students will gain familiarity with the concepts through programming exercises using Python notebooks. Topics to be covered include: basics of statistics and probability theory, probability distributions, estimators, uncertainties, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, Fourier and Monte Carlo methods.

## Online Tools
See [Useful Links](#useful-links) for more information about how to use these tools

* **Campuswire**: We will use [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com) as a class forum, a way to message the course staff and each other, and a means to submit your attendance question.
* **Google Colab**: Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), you will be able to program your code in a jupyter notebook and submit it for us to grade. Please sign in to your Illinois account.  While working on the assignment, you will share each of your colab assignments with the professor and the TA (but no one else).
* **Gradescope**: On [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com), you will submit your assignments and find your graded assignments.

## Coursework

### Computational Assignments
The heart of this course will be a series of computational assignments.
* You will work on the assignments both during class and as homework.
* Each assignment is due at the beginning of the next class unless otherwise noted. You may turn assignment in up to one week late for 50% credit (except that all assignments are strictly due the day before reading day).
* Solutions to the homeworks will not be given.
* The assignments consist of 95% of your grade.
* You may collaborate on assignments but must submit your own work.
* Graded homework will be available through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)

### Take-Home Final
The take-home final is 5% of your grade will involve demonstrating and extending your work in class by doing something cool and interesting.  You must work alone on this (i.e. without collaboration). The list of possible cool and interesting extensions are in the right-bar under "cool extensions for final."  Many of these are projects that are scheduled for future versions of this course but just aren't written yet (and so are at the difficulty level of the other course projects).  If you have a good idea that you would like to propose, please let the course staff know and we may approve it. The projects are not all equally easy (but there are plenty of easy ones if that is your goal.)  The projects are graded on a very coarse-grained 5 point scale:
* 0 points: didn't submit anything
* 1 point: submitted something but nothing really works
* 4 points: most of the project works but it is not complete 
* 5 points: everything works correctly. 
* 2 and 3 points will interpolate between 1-4 points.  

For the take-home final you will put together a jupyter notebook that demonstrates your extension project. The notebook should have code and demonstrate the task but also be written in an expository way that other students could read and learn from. It is submitted in an analogous way as the regular course assignments.

The final notebook must be submitted via Gradescope for grading on or before ___Friday, December 16, 2022 at 5:00 pm US Central time___.

## Grading
* Computational Assignments: 95%
* Take-home final: 5%

Your final numerical score is computed as
100 x (0.95 x (Homework Points + Extra Credit Ponts)/(Total Homework Points) + 0.05 x Final

Unless otherwise noted, every exercise in a problem set counts an equal fraction of the assignment and every part (a,b,c,...) of an exercise counts as an equal fraction of the exercise. 5 points of the problem set will be for mandatory questions (e.g. time spent on assignment, references, collaborators).

Sometimes there are typos in the assignment (although we are working hard to remove them). Please ask when confused! Don't spin your wheels a long time on something that might be a typo. These aren't trick questions - we are trying to ask reasonable things.

## Policies

### Covid 

* Policies as it relates to COVID-19 can be found at https://covid19.illinois.edu
* If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, you should contact your instructor immediately, and you are encouraged to copy your academic advisor. 
  
### About using code you find on the web
The quickest way to deal with the arcana of programing is to ask Google for examples of what you are seeking to accomplish. But you will need to use your judgment in doing this: the Google search “how do I use color maps in python?” is fine, while “show me a script that calculates pi” is not. And you should always credit the original source of code that you paste into your own programs in a comment that includes the URL for the original code. If an author says that his/her code is not to be copied or incorporated into your programs, then DON’T.

I have two principal goals in this course. I want all of you to become fearless coders with the confidence to walk up to baffling problems and pound them into submission. And I want you to develop numerical descriptions of cool systems normally thought to be too difficult for students at your level, whose analytic descriptions might obscure the underlying physics. For this to work, you’ll need to write your own code.

### Academic Integrity
You must never submit the work of someone else as your own. We understand that many of you will find it helpful to work with other students to master Physics 398DAP. But when you collaborate with your study group on homework assignments, you must be a full, active participant in developing the solutions that you submit for credit.

It is cheating to receive answers from another student and then use them as your own. It is cheating to submit as your own work solutions that you find by searching on the worldwide web (though see "About using code you find on the web"), or by subscribing to an online service that suborns cheating. It is cheating—and a violation of U.S. copyright law—to give (or sell) course material to someone else who intends to redistribute and/or sell it.

All activities in this course, are subject to the Academic Integrity rules as described in [Article 1, Part 4, Academic Integrity](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401), of the [Student Code](https://studentcode.illinois.edu).
