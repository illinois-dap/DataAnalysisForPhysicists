        "The [Central Limit Theorem]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)) (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the behavior of the **sampling distribution** of the **sample mean** (or other sample statistics) of a random sample from any population, regardless of its underlying distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem can be stated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "> When independent and identically distributed random variables are sampled from a population, the **distribution of the sample means** approaches a **normal distribution** as the **sample size increases**, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another slightly less precise but more concise statement of the CLT is:\n",
        "> The mean (or sum) of samples drawn from any distribution tends toward a Gaussian distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "A few key points about the CLT:\n",
        "- ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Independence</span>___: The random variables in the sample must be independent, meaning that the outcome of one observation does not affect the outcome of another.\n",
        "- ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Identical Distribution</span>___: Each random variable in the sample must be drawn from the same probability distribution.\n",
        "- ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Sample Size</span>___: As the sample size increases, the **sampling distribution** of the sample mean becomes increasingly closer to a normal distribution, with the mean of the sampling distribution equal to the population mean and a standard deviation (standard error) that depends on the population standard deviation and the square root of the sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CLT is a crucial theorem in probability theory and statistics and has wide-ranging applications in data analysis. It allows us to make statistical inferences about a population based on the distribution of sample means, even when we don't know the exact nature of the population distribution. It provides the theoretical foundation for hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and many other statistical techniques. It is also often used when dealing with large datasets, common in particle physics and astrophysics, as it allows us to assume that the distribution of sample means is approximately normal, simplifying many statistical analyses.\n",
