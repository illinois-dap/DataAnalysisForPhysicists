# Data Analysis for Physics

* Physics 398 DAP, Fall 2023
* Meeting: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:30 am to 11:50 am
* Room: 236 Loomis Laboratory
* 3 credit hours
* Course Text: This one! However, see supplementary reading suggestions throughout the course.

## Overview / Syllabus
Welcome! Data is everywhere. Efficient data analysis leading to solid conclusions requires performant tools and rigorous mathematical techniques tethered by sound scientific methods.

Maybe you have data and not sure how to analyze it. Maybe you are looking to make the most of your precious scientific data and derive sound conclusions not sure how. If so, this course is for you!

This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to data analysis from a physics perspective. Upon completion of this course, students will learn to:
1. Understand common probability distributions and identify examples of where these distributions occur in physics.
2. Identify sources of statistical & systematic uncertainties and bias, and properly handle them to interpret scientific data.
3. Implement key analysis tasks such as parameter estimation, unfolding, auto/cross-correlation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, Monte Carlo simulation, and much more!

You can find more detail in the [Calendar](#calendar) section on the specific topics that will be covered in this course.

## Online Tools
See [Useful Links](#useful-links) for more information about how to use these tools.

* **Campuswire**: We will use [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com) as a class forum, a way to message the course staff and each other, and a means to submit your attendance question.
* **Google Colab**: Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), you will be able to program your code in a jupyter notebook and submit it for us to grade. Please sign in to your Illinois account.  While working on the assignment, you will share each of your colab assignments with the professor and the TA (but no one else).
* **Gradescope**: On [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com), you will submit your assignments and find your graded assignments.

## Coursework

### Homework Assignments
You will be assigned weekly homework assignments that will put into practice what you learned in lecture for the week. 
* You will work on the assignments both during the in-class session on Thursdays and as homework.
* Each assignment is due at the beginning of the next class unless otherwise noted. You may turn assignment in up to one week late for 50% credit (except that all assignments are strictly due the day before Reading Day).
* Solutions to the homeworks will not be given.
* You may collaborate on assignments but must submit your own work.
* Graded homework will be available through [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)

### Final Project
At appropriate times throughout the course, you will select from a list of projects that involve demonstrating and extending your work in class by doing something cool and interesting in data analysys. You must work alone on this (i.e. without collaboration). 

For the final project you will put together a jupyter notebook that demonstrates your project. The notebook should have code and demonstrate the task but also be written in an expository way that other students could, in principle, read and learn from. It is submitted in an analogous way as the regular course assignments.

The final notebook must be submitted via Gradescope for grading on or before ___Xday, December XX, 2023 at 5:00 pm US Central time___.

## Grading
* Class attendence and participation: 10%
* Homework: 70%
* Projects: 20%

Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

| Letter | Low % | High % |
|--------|-------|--------|
| A+     | 97.0  | 100.0  |
| A      | 93.0  | 96.9   |
| A-     | 90.0  | 92.9   |
| B+     | 87.0  | 89.9   |
| B      | 83.0  | 86.9   |
| B-     | 80.0  | 82.9   |
| C+     | 77.0  | 79.9   |
| C      | 73.0  | 76.9   |
| C-     | 70.0  | 72.9   |
| D+     | 67.0  | 69.9   |
| D      | 63.0  | 66.9   |

| F      | 00.0  | 59.9   |
## Policies

### Covid 

* Policies as it relates to COVID-19 can be found at https://covid19.illinois.edu
* If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, you should contact your instructor immediately, and you are encouraged to copy your academic advisor. 
  
### About using code you find on the web for homework and project(s)
The quickest way to deal with the arcana of programing is to ask Google for examples of what you are seeking to accomplish. But you will need to use your judgment in doing this: the Google search “how do I use color maps in python?” is fine, while “show me a script that calculates pi” is not. And you should always credit the original source of code that you paste into your own programs in a comment that includes the URL for the original code. If an author says that his/her code is not to be copied or incorporated into your programs, then DON’T.

### Academic Integrity
You must never submit the work of someone else as your own. We understand that many of you will find it helpful to work with other students to master Physics 398DAP. But when you collaborate with your study group on homework assignments, you must be a full, active participant in developing the solutions that you submit for credit.

It is cheating to receive answers from another student and then use them as your own. It is cheating to submit as your own work solutions that you find by searching on the worldwide web (though see "About using code you find on the web"), or by subscribing to an online service that suborns cheating. It is cheating—and a violation of U.S. copyright law—to give (or sell) course material to someone else who intends to redistribute and/or sell it.

All activities in this course, are subject to the Academic Integrity rules as described in [Article 1, Part 4, Academic Integrity](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401), of the [Student Code](https://studentcode.illinois.edu).
